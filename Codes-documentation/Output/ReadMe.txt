
This ReadMe explains the structure and contents of the Output matrix file, called "Final_Shoreline_Retreats_2024.mat" 

It contains the final results for the years 2050 and 2100 (considering 2 different scenarios from IPCC: SSP-2.4.5 & SSP-5.8.5).
For each year and scenario we consider 5%, 50%, and 95% percentiles to capture the uncertainty of the SLR projections. 

Each row correspond to the hypothetical 5 beach profiles: 
  - Row1: Sandy beach profile 
  - Row2: Sandy beach profile with chronic erosion rate 
  - Row3: Sandy beach profile with rocky outcrop or reef planform 
  - Row4: Sandy beach profile located nearby estuary 
  - Row5: Sandy beach profile with chronic accretion rate and located nearby estuary 

The columns correspond to the final shoreline retreat value depending on the SLR scenarios and percentiles considered: 

The first 6 columns --> 2050 (3 first for the scenario SSP2-4.5, and the following 3 for scenario SSP5-8.5).

   -  Col1: Shoreline retreat acording to SLR scenario SSP2-4.5. for 2050 using the 5%  percentile. 
   -  Col2: Shoreline retreat acording to SLR scenario SSP2-4.5. for 2050 using the 50% percentile. 
   -  Col3: Shoreline retreat acording to SLR scenario SSP2-4.5. for 2050 using the 95% percentile. 

   -  Col4: Shoreline retreat acording to SLR scenario SSP5-8.5. for 2050 using the 5%  percentile. 
   -  Col5: Shoreline retreat acording to SLR scenario SSP5-8.5. for 2050 using the 50% percentile. 
   -  Col6: Shoreline retreat acording to SLR scenario SSP5-8.5. for 2050 using the 95% percentile. 

The last 6 columns --> 2050 (3 first for the scenario SSP2-4.5, and the following 3 for scenario SSP5-8.5).

   -  Col7: Shoreline retreat acording to SLR scenario SSP2-4.5. for 2100using the 5%  percentile. 
   -  Col8: Shoreline retreat acording to SLR scenario SSP2-4.5. for 2100using the 50% percentile. 
   -  Col9: Shoreline retreat acording to SLR scenario SSP2-4.5. for 2100using the 95% percentile. 

   -  Col10: Shoreline retreat acording to SLR scenario SSP5-8.5. for 2100using the 5%  percentile. 
   -  Col11: Shoreline retreat acording to SLR scenario SSP5-8.5. for 2100using the 50% percentile. 
   -  Col12: Shoreline retreat acording to SLR scenario SSP5-8.5. for 2100using the 95% percentile.
